A web based memo that allows you to record anything you want to memorize by tags. This app was inspired by many existing tools and intended to take advantages of all. For this reason, there are many stuff to be done and this is still a ongoing project. You can see the demo [here](http://olmemo.com)

Arp spoofing is a common attack in LAN. It can capture all the packets between any two host talking to each other in the same LAN. You can see the detailed explanation and source code [here](https://github.com/littlemoon-zh/simple_arpspoof).
